    <p>In recent years, the quality of Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation
    has increased dramatically partially due to the significant increase of available 
    parallel corpus. If we talk in terms of space, this advantage becomes a disadvantage 
    because the increased size of the parallel corpus implies an exponential increase in 
    the size of the translation tables. To solve this problem, there are solutions that 
    reduce the size of the translation tables limiting the length of sentences that are 
    incorporated into the tables. This solution reduces the space, but at the expense of 
    increasing the possibility of worsening the translation of long sentences. In this 
    paper, we propose the compression of the phrase-based translation tables using 
    End-Tagged Dense Code to codify the phrases in source and target languages. The use 
    of this technique allows us to reduce the size of translation tables and therefore 
    it is possible to add longer sentences.</p>

    <p>In this paper we introduce our future lines of investigation on the field 
    of Intelligent Agents, focusing on analysing why agents which were well defined 
    according to the guidelines of Agent Oriented Software Engineering, do not show 
    the expected behaviour when they are introduced on a real environment, causing 
    the system to collapse.When addressing to agents malfunctions we will use a metaphor 
    in which agents are considered as patients waiting to be diagnosed. Problems agents 
    show would be equivalent to diseases patients suffer from, and the diagnostic process 
    in agents will also be compared to the procedure followed by physicians when they 
    need to heal patients. Therefore we introduce the concepts of SithGent and 
    SithGent Diagnose, to refer to, sick agents and its diagnostic process.</p>

    <p>The market of ornamental plants is very important and strategical in Galicia and 
    yet is one of the sectors where fewer technological change has been incorporated in 
    recent years. This paper describes a real solution applied to an enterprise of ornamental 
    plant selling and distribution. The solution that we propose uses intelligent agent 
    technologies and ontologies to meet the special needs of an enterprise of this kind. We 
    present the architecture defined with the agents involved in both parties, the plant 
    wholesaler and the plant producers. A description of the ontologies that these agents 
    use to interact is also provided, as well an example of systems behavior. In the final 
    section some relevant issues detected and conclusions will be presented.</p>

    we propose a general classification of them. A selection of three algorithms to work with 
    a concrete platform is presented: CODI, LogMap and MaasMatch. In addition we propose a 
    testbed divided in three groups of tests to evaluate the algorithms. These algorithms were 
    tested and evaluated to verify which was the most suitable for this problem.</p>

    <p>This paper presents the continuation of the research introduced in [10], 
    where a MAS was defined for an enterprise of ornamental plant selling and distribution. 
    When accomplishing the development of this MAS, a problem with the information representation arose, 
    since some of the parties decided to keep their own information representation even if 
    adopting the designed system. Therefore, there was the need to address the information heterogeneity 
    problem, which we do in this paper by using ontologies. The viability of this approach is tested in 
    this paper with a theoretical and practical analysis of ontology alignment techniques applied to MAS.</p>

    <p>In this paper we propose the use of an ontology matching algorithm to
    guarantee the interoperability of the different agents that integrate an smart city.
    In this sort of environment the different parties need to cooperate and to integrate
    their information in order to provide enhanced services to the users of the smart
    city. As the information of these parties may be described by means of different
    and heterogeneous ontologies, we find the solution in the use of ontology
    matching techniques. The algorithm presented was designed to be able to exploit
    the knowledge of previous matched agents to enhance the results and provide the
    most accurate results possible.</p>

    <p>This paper presents a new ontology matching algorithm, OntoPhil. The algorithm relies on the exploitation
    of some initial correspondences or binding points that connect the two ontologies used as input. First, it
    computes these binding points using a new lexical similarity measure which combines the information from a
    terminological matcher and an external one. Next, it discovers new binding points, by taking the initial ones
    as basis and by exploiting the specific features of the external structure of the ontologies matched. Finally,
    the binding points are automatically sifted out to obtain the final alignment. The proposed algorithm was
    tested on the benchmarks provided by the well known evaluation initiative OAEI, and compared to other
    matching algorithms. The experimental results show that OntoPhil is an effective approach and outperform
    other algorithms that share the same principles.</p>

    <p>In this paper we describe a novel proposal in the field of smart cities: using an ontology 
    matching algorithm to guarantee the automatic information exchange between the agents and the smart city. 
    A smart city is composed by different types of agents that behave as producers and/or consumers of the 
    information in the smart city. In our proposal, the data from the context is obtained by sensor and device 
    agents while users interact with the smart city by means of user or system agents. The knowledge of each 
    agent, as well as the smart city’s knowledge, is semantically represented using different ontologies. 
    To have an open city, that is fully accessible to any agent and therefore to provide enhanced services 
    to the users, there is the need to ensure a seamless communication between agents and the city, regardless 
    of their inner knowledge representations, i.e., ontologies. To meet this goal we use ontology matching 
    techniques, specifically we have defined a new ontology matching algorithm called OntoPhil to be deployed 
    within a smart city, which has never been done before. OntoPhil was tested on the benchmarks provided by 
    the well known evaluation initiative, Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative, and also compared to other 
    matching algorithms, although these algorithms were not specifically designed for smart cities. Additionally, 
    specific tests involving a smart city’s ontology and different types of agents were conducted to validate 
    the usefulness of OntoPhil in the smart city environment.</p>

    <p>The amount of research papers published nowadays related to ontology matching is remarkable 
    and we believe that reflects the growing interest of the research community. However, for new 
    practitioners that approach the field, this amount of information might seem overwhelming. 
    Therefore, the purpose of this work is to help in guiding new practitioners get a general idea 
    on the state of the field and to determine possible research lines.
    To do so, we first perform a literature review of the field in the last decade by means of an 
    online search. The articles retrieved are sorted using a classification framework that we propose, 
    and the different categories are revised and analyzed. The information in this review is extended 
    and supported by the results obtained by a survey that we have designed and conducted among 
    the practitioners.</p>

    <p>Smart environments are an important field of study and have suffered from an important 
    evolution in the last decade. Smart technology makes an intensive use of wireless technology 
    as the way of communicating all the elements of the system, including sensors. This paper tries to 
    show how the use of satellites and radio waves may provide smart characteristics to environments 
    that lack the common wireless technologies usually utilized. A system using Agent Oriented Software 
    Engineering and based on that technology has been constructed and shows the suitability and 
    advantages of the proposal.</p>
