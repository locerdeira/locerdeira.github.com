    <p>In recent years, the quality of Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation
    has increased dramatically partially due to the significant increase of available 
    parallel corpus. If we talk in terms of space, this advantage becomes a disadvantage 
    because the increased size of the parallel corpus implies an exponential increase in 
    the size of the translation tables. To solve this problem, there are solutions that 
    reduce the size of the translation tables limiting the length of sentences that are 
    incorporated into the tables. This solution reduces the space, but at the expense of 
    increasing the possibility of worsening the translation of long sentences. In this 
    paper, we propose the compression of the phrase-based translation tables using 
    End-Tagged Dense Code to codify the phrases in source and target languages. The use 
    of this technique allows us to reduce the size of translation tables and therefore 
    it is possible to add longer sentences.</p>

    <p>In this paper we introduce our future lines of investigation on the field 
    of Intelligent Agents, focusing on analysing why agents which were well defined 
    according to the guidelines of Agent Oriented Software Engineering, do not show 
    the expected behaviour when they are introduced on a real environment, causing 
    the system to collapse.When addressing to agents malfunctions we will use a metaphor 
    in which agents are considered as patients waiting to be diagnosed. Problems agents 
    show would be equivalent to diseases patients suffer from, and the diagnostic process 
    in agents will also be compared to the procedure followed by physicians when they 
    need to heal patients. Therefore we introduce the concepts of SithGent and 
    SithGent Diagnose, to refer to, sick agents and its diagnostic process.</p>

    <p>The market of ornamental plants is very important and strategical in Galicia and 
    yet is one of the sectors where fewer technological change has been incorporated in 
    recent years. This paper describes a real solution applied to an enterprise of ornamental 
    plant selling and distribution. The solution that we propose uses intelligent agent 
    technologies and ontologies to meet the special needs of an enterprise of this kind. We 
    present the architecture defined with the agents involved in both parties, the plant 
    wholesaler and the plant producers. A description of the ontologies that these agents 
    use to interact is also provided, as well an example of systems behavior. In the final 
    section some relevant issues detected and conclusions will be presented.</p>

    <p>In this paper, we present a state of the art about Ontology Matching Algorithms and 
    we propose a general classification of them. A selection of three algorithms to work with 
    a concrete platform is presented: CODI, LogMap and MaasMatch. In addition we propose a 
    testbed divided in three groups of tests to evaluate the algorithms. These algorithms were 
    tested and evaluated to verify which was the most suitable for this problem.</p>

    <p>In this paper we propose the use of an ontology matching algorithm to
    guarantee the interoperability of the different agents that integrate an smart city.
    In this sort of environment the different parties need to cooperate and to integrate
    their information in order to provide enhanced services to the users of the smart
    city. As the information of these parties may be described by means of different
    and heterogeneous ontologies, we find the solution in the use of ontology
    matching techniques. The algorithm presented was designed to be able to exploit
    the knowledge of previous matched agents to enhance the results and provide the
    most accurate results possible.</p>

    <p>The amount of research papers published nowadays related to ontology matching is remarkable 
    and we believe that reflects the growing interest of the research community. However, for new 
    practitioners that approach the field, this amount of information might seem overwhelming. 
    Therefore, the purpose of this work is to help in guiding new practitioners get a general idea 
    on the state of the field and to determine possible research lines.
    To do so, we first perform a literature review of the field in the last decade by means of an 
    online search. The articles retrieved are sorted using a classification framework that we propose, 
    and the different categories are revised and analyzed. The information in this review is extended 
    and supported by the results obtained by a survey that we have designed and conducted among 
    the practitioners.</p>
